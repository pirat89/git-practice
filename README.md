# git-practice
This is experimental repository containing lectures/tasks to practice using
of Git. I found that many users learn just elementary of Git and any more
complex task take a lot of tim

The goal of this project is to help to learn new and slightly advanced users of
Git how to use this tool. Basic idea is to provide tasks that will show how
to use Git, firstly just in blind basic (simple) way, that is not usually
optimal and later jump to tasks that point users to optimize their processes
to save time.

Tasks will be added & modified continuosly over time as I do that just in my
free time. Similarly the repository and readme will be modified over time to
find the best concept how to achieve goals of this project.

# Description of tasks
(**Note**:This will be maybe changed. We will see later, according to tasks.)
Each task is in separate branches. Usually a task needs one branch with task
itself and second branch with results, to see expected solution. Default names
of branches contain suffixes:
  -task0001
  -task0001-result

Each branch should contain a **task** file with complete description of the task.
Optionally can contain a **task-result** file that contains instructions, how
to meet goals of the task.


# Sections
**Note**: *This is really just draft. Probably it will be split into different
sections in future.*

1. Elementary
2. Merge and rebase
3. Configuration
4. Search and debug

# Contribution
As I said, I do that just in my free time, so any help is appreciated.
